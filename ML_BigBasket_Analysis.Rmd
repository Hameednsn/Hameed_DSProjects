## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loadlibraries}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
#library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r main}
# Set the working directory
setwd("D:/Machine Learning/Assignment #4")
# Read Porto train and test data set
#porto.traindata <- read.csv(file = "train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
BB.data <- read.csv(file = "BigBasket_csv.csv",  stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
BigB.data <- data.frame(sapply(BB.data[],as.factor))

#Data set summary
str(BigB.data)
summary(BigB.data) 

rules <- apriori(BigB.data, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8))
itemFrequencyPlot(items(rules), topN=10, type="absolute")
# Let us check the top 5 rules generated with only 2 digits and inspect top 5 rules
options(digits = 2)
inspect(rules[1:5])

#The rules shows that someone who buys  
```

```{r method2}
# Set the working directory
setwd("D:/Machine Learning/Assignment #4")
# Read Porto train and test data set
#porto.traindata <- read.csv(file = "train.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
mydata <- read.csv(file = "BigBasket_csv.csv",  stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)

head(mydata)
# Split data with relevant columns
dt <- split(mydata$Description, mydata$Order)

# Now convert data to transaction level
dt2 <- as(dt, "transactions")
summary(dt2)

# Let us get the top 10 items purchased by members
itemFrequencyPlot(dt2, topN = 10, type = "relative")

# Now Aggregate the rules
rules <- apriori(dt2, parameter = list(support= 0.005, confidence = 0.8))

# Convert rules into data frame
rules3 <- as(rules, "data.frame")
write(rules, "D:/Machine Learning/Assignment #4/rules.csv", sep = ",")


#The rules shows that someone who buys  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
