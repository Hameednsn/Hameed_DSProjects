When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r air_quality}
## Read airquality dataset in local r object
airquality.dataframe <- airquality

#structure of the airquality data
str(airquality.dataframe)

#check the number of rows and columns in the dataset
dim(airquality.dataframe)

#summary to check if the fields are read properly in R
summary(airquality.dataframe)

#First eyeball the first 10 rows of the data set
head(airquality.dataframe,10)

#Eyeball the last 10 rows of the data set 
tail(airquality.dataframe,10)

# List the attributes of airquality
names(airquality)

#---------#DATA CLEANSING-----------

# Remmvoe NA from dataset
any(is.na(airquality.dataframe[])) # To check is there any NA value in dataset
sum(is.na(airquality.dataframe[])) # To compute how many NA are in dataset
colSums(is.na(airquality.dataframe)) # To list columns that contains NA

# Remove all NA from data frame except Solar.R as we are not using this variable as of now, 
# we are using Ozone variable for regression let us remove NA from only Ozone
airquality.df.noNA <- na.omit(airquality.dataframe[-2]) 
dim(airquality.df.noNA) # Hers is udpated dataframe with NA removed from Ozone

# --------------------- Point#1: --------------------------
# Run a simple linear regression model using R's in built dataset 'airquality'. 
##  Considering Temp as dependent (Y axis) variable and Ozone as independent variable (X axis). 
##  Write down intercept and slope of Ozone, also explain if it is statistically significant or not?

# R code to address above point
# Let check what type of class are these variables
class(airquality.df.noNA$Temp) 
class(airquality.df.noNA$Ozone)
# Now let us plot scatter plot on both Temp and Ozone variabels
plot(airquality.df.noNA$Temp, airquality.df.noNA$Ozone, main = "Scatterplot", xlab = "Ozone", ylab = "Temp")
# Let us calculate correlation between Tempratary and Ozone variable
cor(airquality.df.noNA$Temp, airquality.df.noNA$Ozone)

# Now let us build simple linear regression on these variables
slr.model <- lm(airquality.df.noNA$Temp ~ airquality.df.noNA$Ozone)
summary(slr.model)

# Now let check the attributes of our model
attributes(slr.model)
# Let write intercept and slope of Ozone
slr.model$coefficients

# Let plot regression line on the linear plot
plot(airquality.df.noNA$Temp, airquality.df.noNA$Ozone, main = "Scatterplot", xlab = "Ozone", ylab = "Temp")
abline(slr.model, col=2, lwd=2) # This line is working fine when we run this cmd on console

#Let check the confidence level
confint(slr.model)
# Summary of our linear regression model
summary(slr.model)

# Conclusion:
# If we observe the summary of simple lenear model ploted using Temp and Ozone variable,from p-value we can make out 
# that Ozone is contributing significately as it has 3 ***, means 'Ozone' is high significant value, i'e p = 0.001, 
# confident level = (i-p) = (1 - 0.001) = 0.999 => 99.9 % confidence, which is > 95%

# ------------------------------- Point#2: -------------------------
# Let us analyse R square and adjusted R square values for this model
# Here, R-squared and Adj R-squared valures are 0.4877 and 0.4832, means Ozone is contributing 48% of overall percentage

```

```{r air_quality_mlr}
# ---------------------- Point#3: -----------------------------
# Multiple linear regression model, Temp as dependent (Y axis) and all others variables as independent (X axis).
# Explain which of the independent variables are statistically significant?

# Now let us build multiple linear regression model considering all the independent variables

mlr.model
summary(mlr.model)

# Conclusion:
# From summary we can make out that only Ozone and month are significately contributing, other variables like solar.R, Wind and Day are not statistically significant, henace taking out these 3 parameter from calcualtion.

# ---------------- Point#4 ----------------------
# Here is new multiple linear regression model with only Ozone and month variable
mlr.model.updated <- lm(new_input_df$Temp ~ new_input_df$Ozone+new_input_df$Month)
mlr.model.updated

# Final multiple regression model is Temp = 55.413+0.187+2.008

# --------------- Point #5 ---------------------
# Here, R-squared and Adj R-squared valures are 0.4877 and 0.4832, means Ozone is contributing 48% of overall percentage

# From summary of udpated multiple regression models R squared and Adj R squared values are 0.6013 and 0.5824
# i'e 60% and 58%. If we compare these R sqared values with simple linear regression model we can see that my adding 
# one more variable we got around 10% jump in contribution. 

```
```{r air_quality_mlr1}
# ----------------------- Point#6 ------------------
# Simple linear regression with imputation, impute NA value with Ozone median by creating new column
# Now let us build simple linear regression model considering Temp as dependent (Y axis) and Ozone-1 as independent (X axis variable)
# Imput NA with Ozone median from Ozone column

# Conclusion:
# If we observe the summary of simple lenear model ploted using Temp and Ozone_1 variable,from Ozone_1 p-value we can make out 
# that Ozone_1 is contributing significately as it has 3 ***, means 'Ozone_1' is high significant value, i'e p = 0.001, 
# confident level = (i-p) = (1 - 0.001) = 0.999 => 99.9 % confidence, which is > 95%

# ------------- Point#7 -------------------------
# Let us analyse R square and adjusted R square values for this new model
# Here, R-squared and Adj R-squared valures are 0.361 as compared to first regression model value of (0.4877) and 0.3568 as compared to first regression model value of (0.4832), means contribution of Ozone_1 reduced as we replaced NA with median value. This will indicate that we have to ignore Ozone NA vlaue than retain for calculation with replacement.
