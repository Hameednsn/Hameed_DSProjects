## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries}
# Load the required libraries
library(forecast)
library(tseries)
```

## Read the input data

```{r InputData}
# Set the working directory
setwd("D:/Adv ML/Assignment#1")

# Read the input data
myLakeData <- read.csv("monthly-lake-erie-levels-1921-19_CSV.csv")
# Do some initial data analysis
head(myLakeData)
tail(myLakeData)
is.ts(myLakeData)
class(myLakeData)

#myLakeData$MonthlyErieLevels <- ts (myLakeData$MonthlyErieLevels, start = c(1, 1), end = c(600, 1))
myLakeData$MonthlyErieLevels <- ts (myLakeData$MonthlyErieLevels, start = c(1921, 1), end = c(1970, 4), frequency = 4)

summary(myLakeData)

dMELevels <- diff(myLakeData$MonthlyErieLevels, 4) # This will cerate year on year differnce
# Plot the differentiated monthly levels
plot(dMELevels)

# Estimating the AR model, here order us (AR I MA)
# Which is mapped to ==================> (p  d  q) , 
# p => Is the coefficient for AR, this is calculated using pacf funtionc()
# d => How many times you apply differntiation to make data stationary 
# q => Is the coefficient for MA, this is calculated using acf funtionc()
fit_diff_AR <- arima(dMELevels, order = c(1,0,0))

# Let us check the Summary of ARIMA model
summary(fit_diff_AR)
# Forecasting for next 5 years
fit_diff_arf <- forecast(fit_diff_AR, h =20)
print(fit_diff_arf)
plot (forecast(fit_diff_arf, include = 20)) # Uses last 10 yrs data to forecats next 5 yrs levels





```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
